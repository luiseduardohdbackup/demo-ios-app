# Demo iOS Application

Nothing special. Just an attempt at writing a native iOS app that communicates
with an API and parses JSON to present a restaurant menu and a map location.

# Where's the php API?

    $ git checkout php-api

The code references a remote URL (that no longer exists). It needs to be changed
to a local one. You can see the hard-coded responses it gets, though.
